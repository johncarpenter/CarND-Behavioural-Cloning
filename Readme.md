Behavioral Cloning
====================

** Udacity Self-Driving Car Project #3 **

This project is a demonstration of deep-learning applied to simulated car navigation. For this project we used a driving simulator to gather steering angles and images from a front-facing camera. Running a deep-learning algorithm on the images we attempted to generated the corresponding steering angle to apply to the simulator.

*** Note: This project requires the Udacity driving simulator. This simulator is not yet publicly available. ***

** Getting Started Running the Simulation **

1. Clone the project

  ``` git clone git@github.com:johncarpenter/CarND-Behavioural-Cloning.git
  ```

2. Install the dependencies.

  This project is built on Keras/Tensorflow, and most easily managed with the Anaconda environment manager.

  Install the dependencies in Linux/OSX using;

  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  source activate BehavioralCloning
  ```

  If you elect to build it the hard way or on windows, the dependencies are all in the environment.yml file.

3. Run the simulator

There are two model files included in the project directory ```model.json``` and ```udacity-model.json```
